                  <p>The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with
                 any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this
                 License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until
                 such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing
                 basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable
                 means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants
                 from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
                 notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You
                 have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You
                 become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.</p>

                 Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted
                 to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this

                 distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.</p>

            <p>Disclaimer of Warranty</p>
            <p>Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis, without
                 warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without
                 limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit
                 for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and
                 performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove
                 defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary
                 servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential
                 part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License
                 except under this disclaimer.

            <p>Limitation of Liability</p>
            <p>Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence),
                 contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered
                 Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special,
                 incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation,
                 damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or
                 malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party
                 shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of
                 liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from
                 such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
                 Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
                 consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

            <p>Litigation</p>
            <p>Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction
                 where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation
                 shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its
                 conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's
                 ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

                 provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be
                 reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation
                 which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
                 shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

                     other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of
                     this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.

                     under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the terms of
                     any subsequent version published by the license steward.

                     license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of this
                     License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of the
                     license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this
                     License).
