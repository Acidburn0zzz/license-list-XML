      <notes>Ruby is disjunctively licensed project that allows the choice of this license and another. The other license
         choice has changed over time (from GPL originally, to BSD-2-Clause currently), so one needs to be
         aware of that change. The Ruby License itself is un-versioned, but has varied a bit over the years,
         the last substantive variation being in 2002.</notes>
